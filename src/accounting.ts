/**
 * Session counters for work magpi did itself. Every number here is measured

 * provider usage reporting, so the whole module runs in a plain unit test and
 * behaves identically in a headless run.
 *
 * The saving magpi claims is context, not bandwidth: fetched content goes to
 * disk and only a preview reaches the prompt, and old previews are later
 * replaced by a path. Both of those are counted here.
